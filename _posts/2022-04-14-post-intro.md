The linear model is such a model that provides sufficient information and pertains to its simplicity. To some degree, we establish recognition and correlation between two entities or events based on this parsimonious setting. This article attempts to introduce the linear model in two contexts, both machine learning, and econometrics.

For years if not decades, econometricians are fighting against machine learning engineers over one issue: causality.
